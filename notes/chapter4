* By default, the Rails console starts in a development environment

* Using puts automatically includes a new line after the string gets printed, the closely related print command prints the
  raw string without the extra line

* The technical name for an extra line of blank space is a newline, typically represented by "backslash n" \n

* The important difference between single- and double-quoted strings is that Ruby won't interpolate single-quoted strings

* Single-quoted strings are often useful because they are truly literal, containing exactly the characters you type

* Ruby functions have an implicit return, meaning they return the last statement evaluated

* If a function contains a default argument it is possible to leave out the argument entirely. In this case it automatically
  takes the given default value

* Modules give us a way to package together related methods, which can then be mixed in to Ruby classes using include

* If we trace back the class hierarchy of any Ruby object far enough every class in Ruby ultimately inherits from
  BasicObject, which has no superclass itself

* Ruby classes can be opened and modified, allowing ordinary people to add methods to them. However, it's considered bad
  form to do so without having a really good reason

* Attribute accessors create "getter" and "setter" methods that allow us to retrieve (get) and assign (set) instance
  variables

* Ruby blocks are a flexible construct that (among other things) allow natural iteration over enumerable data structures
