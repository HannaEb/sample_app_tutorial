* Gems are self-contained solutions to specific problems such as pagination and image upload

* There are three essential components needed to develop web applications: a text editor, a filesystem navigator, and a
  command-line terminal

* The rails new command creates a skeleton Rails application

* Running rails new automatically runs the bundle install command after the file creation is done

* Unless you specify a version number to the gem command, Bundler will automatically install the latest requested version
  of the gem

* There are two common ways to specify a gem version range:
      gem 'example', '>= 1.3.0'
          This installs the latest version of the gem as long as it is greater than or equal to version 1.3.0

      gem 'example', '~> 4.0.0'
          This installs the gem as long as it is newer than version 4.0.0 and not newer than 4.1

* Always run bundle install after changing the gem file

* The rails server or rails s command runs a local webserver on a local system

* MVC is an architectural pattern which enforces a separation between the data in the application and the code used to
  display it

* When interacting with a Rails app, a browser sends a request, which is received by a webserver and passed on to a Rails
  controller, which is in charge of what to do next. In some cases, the controller will immediately render a view, which
  is a template that gets converted to HTML and sent back to the browser. More commonly for dynamic sites, the controller
  interacts with a model, which is a Ruby object that represents an element of the site and is in charge of
  communicating with the database.

* The default page, the root route, determines the page that is served on the root URL and can be changed in routes.rb

* Version control systems allow us to track changes to our project's code, collaborate more easily, and roll back any
  inadvertent errors

* The two most popular sites for hosting Git repositories are GitHub and Bitbucket. GitHub offers unlimited free
  repositories (with collaboration) for open-source repositories while charging for private repos, whereas Bitbucket
  allows unlimited free private repos while charging for more than a certain number of collaborators. Recently, a third
  major Git hosting company has emerged: GitLab allows for unlimited public and private repos.

* Markdown is a human-readable markup language designed to be easy to convert to HTML

* Heroku is a hosted platform build specifically for deploying Rails and other web applications

* SQLite isn't supported at Heroku so the gem needs to be prevented from being included in a production environment in
  the Gemfile

* To prevent the local installation of any production gems run bundle install --without production before deploying the app

* Ruby on Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language

* Installing Rails, generating an application, and editing the resulting files is easy using a pre-configured cloud
  environment

* Rails comes with a command-line command called rails that can generate new applications and run local servers
