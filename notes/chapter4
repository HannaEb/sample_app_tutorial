* By default, the Rails console starts in a development environment

* Using puts automatically includes a new line after the string gets printed, the closely related print command prints the
  raw string without the extra line

* The technical name for an extra line of blank space is a newline, typically represented by "backslash n" \n

* The important difference between single- and double-quoted strings is that Ruby won't interpolate single-quoted strings

* Single-quoted strings are often useful because they are truly literal, containing exactly the characters you type

* Ruby functions have an implicit return, meaning they return the last statement evaluated

* If a function contains a default argument it is possible to leave out the argument entirely. In this case it automatically
  takes the given default value
