* The default environment for the Rails console is development but if you ever need to run a console in a different
  environment you can pass the environment as a parameter to the console script:
    $ rails console test

* Development is also the default environment for the Rails server, but you can run it in a different environment:
    $ rails server --environment production

* If you view your app running in production, it won't work without a production database, which we can create:
    $ rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

* A mixin allows a group of CSS rules to be packaged up and used for multiple elements

* Adding resources :users to config.ru adds a working /users/1 URL and also endows the app with all the actions needed for a
  RESTful Users resource, along with a large number of named routes for generating user URLs

* In order to get the user show view to work, we need to define an @user instance variable in the corresponding show action
  in the Users controller

* Whenever you're confused about something in a Rails application, it's a good practice to put debugger close to the code
  you think might be causing the trouble. Inspecting the state of the system using byebug is a powerful method for tracking
  down application errors and interactively debugging your app.
