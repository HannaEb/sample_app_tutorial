* Persistent cookies are vulnerable to session hijacking, in which an attacker uses a stolen remember token to log in
  as a particular user

* There are four main ways to steal cookies:
    1. using a packet sniffer to detect cookies being passed over insecure networks
    2. compromising a database containing remember tokens
    3. using XSS
    4. gaining physical access to a machine with a logged-in user

* The urlsafe_base64 method from the SecureRandom module in the Ruby standard library returns a random string of length
  22 composed of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - and _

* A cookie consists of two pieces of information, a value and an optional expires date

* cookies.permanent[:remember_token] = remember_token causes Rails to set the expiration to 20.years.from_now
  automatically

* Bootstrap uses the CSS classes checkbox and inline to put the checkbox and the text in the same line

* Using the cookies method, we create a persistent session by placing a permanent remember token cookie in the
  browser
