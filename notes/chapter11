* Metaprogramming is essentially a program that writes a program

* Like sessions, account activations can be modeled as a resource despite not being Active Record objects

* Rails can generate Action Mailer actions and views to send email

* As with ordinary actions and views, instance variables defined in mailer actions are available in mailer views

* Account activations use e generated token to create a unique URL for activating users

* Account activations use a hashed activation digest to securely identify valid activation requests

* We can send email in production using SendGrid
